1. This script will remotely log in to a machine with ip address 192.168.1.25 and changes the root password to 'bland'.

2.  Make sure first you had done this and then run the masterscript.sh

  step1:  from your local machine:

   ssh-copy-id root@192.168.1.25
  
   What this will do is: => It will tell the system to copy the local system's /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file to the remote system 192.168.1.25's /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file, thereby resulting in our system to become a "trusted system" for 192.168.1.25 and from then on it wont ask for password when we log in via ssh.

3. Now, run
as follows:

bash masterscript.sh >> /opt/Output 2>&1 

4. Now, test it!!
